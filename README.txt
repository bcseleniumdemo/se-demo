Gustavo and I had a great talk about future selenium goals with PQA. The hope was to eliminate manual testing, using a suite of 50 tests across all supported browsers. 

I've been down this road and learned some lessons. I put together a demo showing some solutions, with screenshot comparison and running the same test cross-browser. 

The test classes are ShoppingCartPage_IT and ProductDetailPage_IT. You'll need PhantomJS on the system path - http://phantomjs.org/download.html

Great talking with everyone, I hope this is of some use.
